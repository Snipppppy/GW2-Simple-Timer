# GW2 Simple Timer


## A Simple GuildWars2 Meta Event Timer

---

For one, I built this timer as a hobby project to learn how to code.
And secondly, because none of the timers already in existence have the use case I wanted, or they didn't cover the latest game expansions.

The timer is intended to stick on a second monitor.
To keep an eye on what happens next, in the fantastic world of Tyria.
